&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Allows you to randomize your starting map to help you find one you like. Getting new positions for just the steam geysers is also possible.

&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
Start a new game. In the top right corner of the screen you will find a button with red dice. Click that.
Use "Reroll Map" to get an entirely new starting map or "Reroll Geysers" to get random new geyser positions on the current map.
Each operation will cost you an amount of unmined resources from the map- both the cost and the amount of remaining resources are displayed in the window.

Note, that rerolling becomes unavailable after naming your colony or loading it from a save file.

If you are using Community Core Library (CCL) you might want to temporarily disable the minimap, as it covers up the button.
